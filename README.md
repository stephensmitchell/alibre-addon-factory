I have two main types of Alibre Design add-on repositories: Alibre Script–based add-ons and regular Alibre Design add-ons.
Regular add-ons can be demos, PoCs, and can also be Alibre Script–based. Alibre Script–based demonstration/PoC add-ons are made for evaluating add-ons created solely with Alibre Script as the command.
